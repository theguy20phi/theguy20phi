### Hello!
My name is Braden and I am a senior at Arkansas Tech University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. 
I have been involved in the VEX Robotics Competition for several years and am currently the Secretary for the ATU Robotics Club.
Some of my work in robotics can be seen in pinned repositories.
